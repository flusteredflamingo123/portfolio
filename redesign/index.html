        <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
        <div class = "content">
            <div class="orange">
                <div class="center"><h2>Overview</h2></div>
                <p> Toward the beginning of the course, I learned how to analyze a webpage for its usability, learnability, and memorability.
                    To test these skills, I identified usability problems with an existing website and 
                    went through the process of redesigning and developing an improved version with greater responsiveness.</p>
                <p> The flawed webpage I chose to redesign was this night sky tracker: </p>
                <div class ="center"><img id="flawed" src="images/webpage.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Sky and Telescope's interactive sky chart webpage."></div>
            </div>
            <div class="orange">
                <div class="center"><h2>Process</h2></div>
                <p>First, I divided the issues I observed with the webpage into the categories of usability, learnability, and memorability.</p>
                <div class="center">
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Usability</th>
                            <th>Learnability</th>
                            <th>Memorability</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In order to update the date or time, a submit button must be pressed, which is less efficient than automatically 
                                        updating the page when the date or time is changed.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        On mobile, the star chart shrinks such that pieces of text overlap one another, making it difficult to read
                                        the chart's information.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        On mobile, you cannot press the change time buttons while also viewing how the sky image moves as a result, so 
                                        the user is required to scroll back and forth to see the effect of their actions.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The controls for setting the date and location are the only settings needed to begin using the page, 
                                        so these options should be separated in the top left. Currently, it is difficult for new users to determine what they need to interact with.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        The area of the sky that is displayed can be moved by dragging the window on the sky chart, a feature that is not at
                                        signaled to the user.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        There is no clear hierarchy, as headers have barely more weight than other text, and the interactable components
                                        are mostly not aligned with one another.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The "Display Options" are not organized, making it difficult for a returning user to remember where certain
                                        settings are located.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Returning users who recall changing what part of the sky is displayed by clicking and dragging might
                                        drag the sky image itself, which does not work. This feature could be included to eliminate the need for users
                                        to remember exactly where this control is located.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </div>
                <p>Then, I designed low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes showcasing how the page could be redesigned. 
                    I made similar prototypes for the tablet and mobile versions of the page.
                </p>
                <div class="center"><img src="images/wireframe1.PNG" alt="A wireframe for the redesigned desktop page."></div>
                <div class="center"><img src="images/hifi1.PNG" alt="A high-fidelity prototype for the redesigned desktop page."></div>
                <p>
                    Finally, I developed the redesigned page.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="orange">
                <div class="center"><h2>Result</h2></div>

            </div>
            <div class="orange">
