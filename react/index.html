        <h1>React Development</h1>
        <div class = "content">
            <div class="orange">
                <div class="center"><h2>Overview</h2></div>
                <p> Before this project, I had little experience making webpages truly interactive. This project taught me how to use React
                    to pass data between different components of a page and update what is displayed on screen in response.
                </p>
                <p> To demonstrate these skills, I wanted to make a Scrabble tool that would showcase the various words that could be made
                    with a set of letters and allow the user to sort and filter the words in a number of ways.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="orange">
                <div class="center"><h2>Process</h2></div>
                <p>
                    Each word would be displayed on a card. This card would show information about the word and feature a button 
                    allowing the user to add the word to a list that tracks the total score of the selected words. Naturally, this card
                    was implemented as its own React component where its props were the word that the card contains and the function that
                    should be triggered when the "Add to List" button is pressed.
                </p>
                <div class="center"><img id = "card" src="images/card.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the card component."></div>
                <p>
                    The other main component was a menu that contained the options for filtering and sorting the cards and the list of selected words.
                    This component is passed functions defining what to do when each option is selected.
                </p>
                <div class="center"><img id = "card" src="images/menu.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the card component."></div>
                <p>
                    Whenever a filter or sort is used, a state variable within the main app component is updated, altering how cards 
                    are rendered on the page. These changes are easily reversible by selecting a new set of options or by pressing the "Reset" button.
                </p>
